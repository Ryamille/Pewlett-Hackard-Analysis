# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to show the number of retiring employees per title and to also identify the employees who are eliigible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Results
### Unique Titles
-  Of the 300,024 included in this data an immense amount at 72,458 are up for retirement.
- This is 24% of the whole staff.
- From the Uniqe Titles table it shows that there are 25,916 Senior Engineers about to retire and followed right behind is the Senior Staff with 24,926.
- The sum of the remaining position titles add up to 21,616.

### Mentorship Eligibility
- The data for the Mentorship Eligibility table used birth dates between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965/
- Only 1,549 were able to qualify for a mentorship role.
- Unfortuantly none of the eligible mentors are managers.
- 
## Summary
For the 72,458 retiring 25,916 are Senior Engineers, 24,926 are Senior Staff, 9285 are Engineers, 7,636 are Staff, 3,603 are Technique Leaders, 1,090 are Assistant Engineers, and only 2 are Managers.
I believe with the low amount of mentors and such an incredibly high amount of retirement ready emnployees just numbers wise there will be a struggle to train the next generation. THe data showed mentors are only 2% of the upcoming group of retiring employees.
